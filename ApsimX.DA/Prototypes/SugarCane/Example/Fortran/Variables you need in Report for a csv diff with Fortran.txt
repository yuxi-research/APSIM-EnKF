Having all these variables in a Report makes the Run take about 2 minutes to complete.
So I have left them out of the Report by default and only leave in the variables that I am doing the stats comparisons on.
eg. cane_wt, sucrose_wt, lai, etc.
This means I won't slow down the time it takes for Jenkins to do its testing (after someone does a commit) by outputing variables that aren't even used in the Stats tests. 

But if you ever want to do an "Export to CSV" from the DataStore and then do a diff on the CSV's produced, you will need to add all these variables back in.
