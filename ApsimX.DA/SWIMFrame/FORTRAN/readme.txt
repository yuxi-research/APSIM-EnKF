The file "test.txt" gives the compilation instructions for the program "test.f95".
This program generates two soil property files and seven flux table files - two for
soil 0103, with dz values of 0050 and 0100 mm, and four for soil 0109, with dz values
from 0100 to 0400 mm. The seventh file is for a composite path through both soils.
The file "test_output.txt" gives the console output, with sizes of the tables and
timings in s. The first and fourth times are for generating soil properties and the last
is for generating the composite path table from two individual soil tables.
