	abstract = {With current annual production at over 600 million tonnes, wheat is the third largest crop in the world behind corn and rice, and an essential source of carbohydrates for millions of people. While wheat is grown over a wide range of environments, it is common in the major wheat-producing countries for grain filling to occur when soil moisture is declining and temperature is increasing. Average global temperatures have increased over the last decades and are predicted to continue rising, along with a greater frequency of extremely hot days. Such events have already been reported for major wheat growing regions in the world. However, the direct impact of past temperature variability and changes in averages and extremes on wheat production has not been quantified. Attributing changes in observed yields over recent decades to a single factor such as temperature is not possible due to the confounding effects of other factors. By using simulation modelling, we were able to separate the impact of temperature from other factors and show that the effect of temperature on wheat production has been underestimated. Surprisingly, observed variations in average growing-season temperatures of {\textpm}2~{{\textdegree}C} in the main wheat growing regions of Australia can cause reductions in grain production of up to 50\%. Most of this can be attributed to increased leaf senescence as a result of temperatures \&gt;34~{{\textdegree}C.} Temperature conditions during grain filling in the major wheat growing regions of the world are similar to the Australian conditions during grain filling. With average temperatures and the frequency of heat events projected to increase world-wide with global warming, yield reductions due to higher temperatures during the important grain-filling stage alone could substantially undermine future global food security. Adaptation strategies need to be considered now to prevent substantial yield losses in wheat from increasing future heat stress.},

	abstract = {High rates of drainage and leaching of nitrates in deep sands in Western
Australia are contributing to groundwater recharge and soil acidification in
this region. Strategies are being soughtto increase water and nitrogen (N) use
in the legume-based cropping systems. Choice of appropriate management
strategies is complicated by the diversity of soil types, the range of crops,
and the inherent season to season variability. Simulation models provide the
means to extrapolate beyond the bounds of experimental data if accurate
predictions of key processes can be demonstrated. This paper evaluates the
accuracy of predictions of soil water content, evapotranspiration, drainage,
inorganic N content insoil, nitrate
({NO-3)} leaching, wheat growth, N
uptake, and grain yields obtained from the Agricultural Production Systems
Simulator ({APSIM)} model when this was initialised with appropriate
information on soil properties and wheat varieties commonly grown on deep sands
in the 500 mm rainfall zone west of Moora in Western Australia. The model was
found to give good predictions of soil water content,evapotranspiration, deep
drainage, and overall {NO-3}
leaching. Temporal changes in inorganic N insoil were simulated, although the
small concentrations in soil inorganic N precluded close matching of paired
observed and predicted values. Crop growth and N uptake were closely predicted
up to anthesis, but a poor fit between observed and predicted crop growth and N
uptake was noted postanthesis. Reasons for the discrepancies between modelled
and observed values are outlined.


The model was run with historical weather data (81 years) and different
initial soil water and inorganic soil N profiles to assess the probability of
drainage and {NO-3} leaching, and
the grain yield potentials for wheat grown on deep sands in the region west of
Moora. Simulation showed that thesoil water and the soil inorganic N content
at the beginning of each season had no effect on grain yield, implying that
pre-seed soil {NO-3} was largely
lost from the soil by leaching. There was a 50\% probability that 141 mm
of winter rainfall could drain below 1{\textperiodcentered}5 m and a 50\% probability
that 53 {kgN/ha} could be leached under wheat following a lupin crop, where
initial soil water contents andsoil
{NO-3} contents used in the model
were those measured in a deep sand after late March rainfall. Simulated
application of N fertiliser at sowing increased both grain yield and
{NO-3} leaching. Splitting the N
application between the time of sowing and 40 days after sowing decreased
{NO-3} leaching,increased N uptake
by wheat, and increased grain yield, findings which are consistent with
agronomic practice.

The high drainage and leaching potential of these soils were identified as the
main reasons why predicted yields did not approach the French and Schultz
potential yield estimates based on 20 kg grain yield per mm of rainfall. When
the available water was reduced by simulated drainage, simulated grain yields
for the fertilised treatments approached the potential yield line.},

The model was used to simulate above- and belowground growth, grain yield, water and N uptake, and soil water and soil N in wheat crops in Western Australia. Model outputs were compared with detailed field experiments from four rainfall zones, three soil types, and five wheat genotypes. The field experiments covered 10 seasons, with variations in sowing date, plant density, N fertiliser, deep ripping and irrigation. The overall {APSIM} model predictions of shoot growth, root depth, water and N uptake, soil water, soil N, drainage and nitrate leaching were found to be acceptable. Grain yields were well predicted with a coefficient of determination r2(1:1)=0.77, despite some underestimation during severe terminal droughts. Yields tended to be underestimated during terminal droughts due to insufficient pre-anthesis stored carbohydrates being remobilised to the grain. Simulation of grain protein, and depth to the perched water table showed limited accuracy when compared with field measurements. In particular, grain protein tended to be overpredicted at high protein levels and underpredicted at low levels. However, specific simulation studies to predict biomass, yield, drainage and nitrate leaching are now possible for wheat crops on the tested soil types and rainfall zones in Western Australia.},

	abstract = {Systems approaches can help to evaluate and improve the agronomic and economic viability of nitrogen application in the frequently water-limited environments. This requires a sound understanding of crop physiological processes and well tested simulation models. Thus, this experiment on spring wheat aimed to better quantify water{\texttimes}nitrogen effects on wheat by deriving some key crop physiological parameters that have proven useful in simulating crop growth. For spring wheat grown in Northern Australia under four levels of nitrogen (0 to 360 kg N ha-1) and either entirely on stored soil moisture or under full irrigation, kernel yields ranged from 343 to 719 g m-2. Yield increases were strongly associated with increases in kernel number (9150{\textendash}19950 kernels m-2), indicating the sensitivity of this parameter to water and N availability. Total water extraction under a rain shelter was 240 mm with a maximum extraction depth of 1.5 m. A substantial amount of mineral nitrogen available deep in the profile (below 0.9 m) was taken up by the crop. This was the source of nitrogen uptake observed after anthesis. Under dry conditions this late uptake accounted for approximately 50\% of total nitrogen uptake and resulted in high ({\textgreater}2\%) kernel nitrogen percentages even when no nitrogen was applied. Anthesis {LAI} values under sub-optimal water supply were reduced by 63\% and under sub-optimal nitrogen supply by 50\%. Radiation use efficiency ({RUE)} based on total incident short-wave radiation was 1.34 g {MJ-1} and did not differ among treatments. The conservative nature of {RUE} was the result of the crop reducing leaf area rather than leaf nitrogen content (which would have affected photosynthetic activity) under these moderate levels of nitrogen limitation. The transpiration efficiency coefficient was also conservative and averaged 4.7 Pa in the dry treatments. Kernel nitrogen percentage varied from 2.08 to 2.42\%. The study provides a data set and a basis to consider ways to improve simulation capabilities of water and nitrogen effects on spring wheat.},

A single set of parameters which are slightly dependent on latitude are derived for use with daily irradiance data (typical R2 [approximate] 0.90). Comparisons with previously published regressions from the northern hemisphere indicate that the model and parameters are also suitable for use in that hemisphere. A theoretical approach is used to scale the daily model to a monthly basis and subsequent testing established the validity of the theoretical approach. However, for practical applications, empirical relationships are necessary to estimate the variances and covariances which are part of the theory but which are not normally available in databases. A final empirical scaling model was developed to estimate the monthly average daily diffuse radiation ({RMS} = 0.91 {MJ} m-2 day-1, R2 = 0.86, N = 2780).

From the calculated leaf area index the daily intercepted solar radiation by the crop was determined. Daily carbon accumulation was calculated as a linear function of intercepted radiation. The daily nitrogen accumulation rate was calculated as a linear function of vegetative biomass. Leaf growth, carbon accumulation and symbiotic-nitrogen fixation rates were all made sensitive to the amount of soil water. Experimental data were collected to develop the empirical relationships between these three physiological processes and the amount of transpirable soil water. These data showed nitrogen fixation rates to be more sensitive to soil dehydration than either leaf growth or leaf gas exchange. Preliminary tests showed that model predictions compared favorably with field observations. An analysis of the model's behavior showed that crop yield was most sensitive to those variables influencing the interception of solar radiation and its conversion to biomass.},

	abstract = {Soils with high levels of chloride and/or sodium in their subsurface layers are often referred to as having subsoil constraints ({SSCs).} There is growing evidence that {SSCs} affect wheat yields by increasing the lower limit of a crop{\textquoteright}s available soil water ({CLL)} and thus reducing the soil{\textquoteright}s plant-available water capacity ({PAWC).} This proposal was tested by simulation of 33 farmers{\textquoteright} paddocks in south-western Queensland and north-western New South Wales. The simulated results accounted for 79\% of observed variation in grain yield, with a root mean squared deviation ({RMSD)} of 0.50~t/ha. This result was as close as any achieved from sites without {SSCs}, thus providing strong support for the proposed mechanism that {SSCs} affect wheat yields by increasing the {CLL} and thus reducing the soil{\textquoteright}s {PAWC.} In order to reduce the need to measure {CLL} of every paddock or management zone, two additional approaches to simulating the effects of {SSCs} were tested. In the first approach the {CLL} of soils was predicted from the 0.3{\textendash}0.5~m soil layer, which was taken as the reference {CLL} of a soil regardless of its level of {SSCs}, while the {CLL} values of soil layers below 0.5~m depth were calculated as a function of these soils{\textquoteright} 0.3{\textendash}0.5~m {CLL} values as well as of soil depth plus one of the {SSC} indices {EC}, Cl, {ESP}, or Na. The best estimates of subsoil {CLL} values were obtained when the effects of {SSCs} were described by an {ESP-dependent} function. In the second approach, depth-dependent {CLL} values were also derived from the {CLL} values of the 0.3{\textendash}0.5~m soil layer. However, instead of using {SSC} indices to further modify {CLL}, the default values of the water-extraction coefficient (kl) of each depth layer were modified as a function of the {SSC} indices. The strength of this approach was evaluated on the basis of correlation of observed and simulated grain yields. In this approach the best estimates were obtained when the default kl values were multiplied by a Cl-determined function. The kl approach was also evaluated with respect to simulated soil moisture at anthesis and at grain maturity. Results using this approach were highly correlated with soil moisture results obtained from simulations based on the measured {CLL} values. This research provides strong evidence that the effects of {SSCs} on wheat yields are accounted for by the effects of these constraints on wheat {CLL} values. The study also produced two satisfactory methods for simulating the effects of {SSCs} on {CLL} and on grain yield. While Cl and {ESP} proved to be effective indices of {SSCs}, {EC} was not effective due to the confounding effect of the presence of gypsum in some of these soils. This study provides the tools necessary for investigating the effects of {SSCs} on wheat crop yields and natural resource management ({NRM)} issues such as runoff, recharge, and nutrient loss through simulation studies. It also facilitates investigation of suggested agronomic adaptations to {SSCs.}},

	abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer ({DSSAT}) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the {DSSAT} crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the {DSSAT} crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new {DSSAT} cropping system model ({CSM}) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the {CSM} to those that operate the {DSSAT}–{CSM} to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new {DSSAT}–{CSM} design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the {DSSAT} crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed {DSSAT}–{CSM} will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},
