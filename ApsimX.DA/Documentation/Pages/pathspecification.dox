/*! \page pathspecification Path Specification 
Paths are structured similarly to directory paths in 
Windows and Unix, using a '.' character instead of slashes. 
\section relative_path Relative paths
Relative paths are relative to the model that is using the path e.g.
"Report" - relative path - refers to the child model called Report
"Soil.Water" - relative path - refers to the child Water model of the child Soil model.
///
\section absolute_path Absolute paths
Absolute paths have a leading '.' e.g.
".Simulations.Test.Clock" - absolute path - refers to the 
clock model in the 'Test' simulation.
///
\section scoped_path Scoped paths
Scoped paths have a leading model type in square brackets. 
A model of the specified name, in scope, is located before 
applying the rest of the path.
"[Soil].Water" - scoped path - refers to the Water model that 
is a child of a model that has the name 'Soil' that is in scope.
